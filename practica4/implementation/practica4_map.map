Mapping design into LUTs...
Writing file practica4_map.ngm...
Running directed packing...
ERROR:Pack:2811 - Directed packing was unable to obey the user design
   constraints (LOC=M3) which requires the combination of the symbols listed
   below to be packed into a single IOB component.

   The directed pack was not possible because: More than one pad symbol.
   The symbols involved are:
   	BUF symbol "mover_derecha_pin_IBUF" (Output Signal = mover_derecha_pin_IBUF)
   	PAD symbol "mover_derecha_pin" (Pad Signal = mover_derecha_pin)
   	PAD symbol "leds<2>" (Pad Signal = leds<2>)

Mapping completed.
See MAP report file "practica4_map.mrp" for details.
